This code in on early stage, don't expect too much out of box.

=HowTo Build Project With FCSH=

Put build.el file in root of your Flex project. It must contain
build target, that similar to code below:
;; fcsh-mode compile settings
((compiler "mxmlc")
 (flags "-incremental=true -optimize=true -actionscript-file-encoding=UTF-8")
 (script "/absolute/pathTo/yourProject/Main.mxml"))

than do M-x flashdev-fcsh-build

=Troubleshooting=

To understand how it works see source :).
